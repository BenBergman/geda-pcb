# by using a wrapper script we avoid all the nastyness of needing to
# be root to install an X11 app-defaults file in the X11 install 
# directories.  This will allow Pcb to be fully installed anywhere
# and still find its application defaults

# execute pcb

# If the first argument is "-gdb" then run PCB inside the gdb
# debugger.
