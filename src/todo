MoveLayers - need to move thermal and PIP flags too, plus undo of
deleting a layer with stuff on it.

-------------------- HID Validation Stuff --------------------

[gtk]

Do something with LayerGroupsChanged action.

Test all menu actions.

Verify all config items are saved/loaded properly.

Review for additions to make to the Preferences window.

Clean up popup: populate with common actions and remove select tool part.
Evaluate its value given tearoff menus?


-------------------- Lesstif Enhancements --------------------

Pan(x, y, zoomfactor) - pans screen, zooms, sets crosshairs on coordinate.

-------------------- HID Enhancements --------------------

EPS: option to specify which layers and order to draw in.

PS: Option for single or multi file.

     a different name...
PNG: add option to specify output image max dimension
 
Add direct-to-pdf exporter?

-------------------- Core Issues/Enhancements ---------------


lots of #ifdef FIXME in the core code.  Some actions need fixing
up in these areas.

Adjust minimum symbol line size based on current layer; don't assume
silk layer.  Note: need "thin" lines for pinout windows still.

SearchObjectByLocation() needs to search front side silk, elements,
etc, before back side ones.

-------------------- Action Enhancements --------------------

Default functions for ":"
 - tab expansion

Generic "set hid attribute" action.

-------------------- Long Term Projects --------------------

Switch to topological autorouter.

Global "puller" optimizer.

Constrain all objects to have the same fields first in their data
structures; convert most internal functions to use this AnyObject type
instead of N functions for N object types.

Win32 and MacOS HIDs.
