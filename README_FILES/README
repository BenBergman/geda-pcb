Pcb is a handy tool for the X Window System to design
printed circuit boards. All coordinate units are 1/1000 inch.
For details see the manual.

The only requirements are:

1. An installation of X11 including header files and the athena
   widget library (HP users that means you), GNU M4, flex
   and bison. X11R6, GNU flex and GNU bison are highly recommended.

2. An ANSI compiler (eg GCC) and maybe a newer version of bison and flex
   as a replacement for yacc and lex. See 'Problems' in the manual.

3. A 'long' filesystem
