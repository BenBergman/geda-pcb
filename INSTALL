-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous releases have been successfully compiled on the following platforms:

X11R4
	Check the GNU info file for problems.
	The dynamic offset for printouts is not supported because of the
	missing panner widget. This version NOW REQUIRES X11R6


HP-UX 10.10
	All HP machines require the MIT release of X11R6
	HP does not ship the Athena Widgets with its release nor
	necessary tools like imake... but you can get them as a patch.
	You will also have to get yourself an ANSI compiler if you are stuck
	with HPs cc.

Sun Solaris 2.5.1
	You won't have any problems if you use X11R5 or later. 
	Using OpenWindows will cause some of them. See the GNU info file for
	details about it.

Silicon Graphics IRIX 5.3, 6.2 and 6.4
	No problems beside additional CFLAGS in Imakefile. Check if you are
	using a R4 server and, if you do, read the GNU info file of pcb.

Linux 0.99pl14 and later, XFree 2.1.1 and later
	No problems; it's the developement platform.

SCO ODT 3.0 (probably, couldn't check the current release)
	Needs tls003 of the Athena Widget library from sosco.sco.com
	(mailed by John DuBois <spcecdt@deeptht.armory.com>).

FreeBSD (probably, couldn't check the current release)

NetBSD 
	No problems

DEC UNIX V3.2, V4.0

This specific release has been installed and tested on GNU/Linux 2.4.10, X11R6,
specifically linux-pmac! based on the 2.4.10 kernel. This is a
redhat 7 based derivative, but few of the changes should materially
affect the other platforms described above. The special caveats to
those machines still apply.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick install for the sloppy:

# ./configure
# make
# cd src
# ./pcbtest.sh


if everything is working good, quit then:
# cd ..
# make install

Do that last step as root.

More formal installation instructions:

     ***** YOU MUST HAVE AN ANSI COMPILER TO COMPILE THESE SOURCES *****

Here's how to install:

1. Run the configure script.  This is a standard GNU configure script.
   In the simplest case you just run

     ./configure
   
   This will configure PCB to install to /usr/local 
   To change the installation prefix to /opt/pcb , use

     ./configure --prefix=/opt/pcb

   See

     ./configure --help 

   for a full list of options

2. Run make to compile the software

     make

3. Get yourself a printed copy of the documentation (available in
   ./doc/).
   Read 'Whats_new*' to see if old file have to be updated.


4. Test the program before you install it to see if the application defaults
   match your window environment.
       cd src
       ./pcbtest.sh
   does the trick.
   
5. Take the printed copies from (3) and check if the translations work
   (see chapter 'Getting Started') by running
       ./pcbtest.sh ../example/LED2
   It comes up with a LED board layout you can play with.

   Take special care on the resources related to functions keys and the
   pointer buttons because most of the window managers use them too.
 
6. When you're satisfied with the defaults and the program run:
       cd ..
       make install
   as a user with the appropriate rights. Depending on the filemodes set
   by your X11 environment you must remove existing copies of fonts,
   manpage and program before you are able to install successfully.
   Set umask to 022 else the new created directories wont be world
   readable; the fonts cannot be found.

6. Read 'MAILING' in this directory.


If you create any element files or package description files I would be glad
to get a copy to include them into the next release or an additional archive.

Have fun with it.
