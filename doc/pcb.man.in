.SH NAME
Pcb \- X11 interactive printed circuit board layout system

.SH VERSION

.P
The current release is: @VERSION@

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcb
[\-option ...] [\-toolkit_option ...] [description file]

or

.B pcb
\-specialoption

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P 
\fIPcb\fP is a handy tool for the \fIX Window System\fP build to design
printed circuit boards. All coordinate units are 1/1000 inch.
It implements the most needed features like:

.IP
* A layout consists of lines, arcs, polygons, elements (pins, pads and silkscreen),
vias and text information seperated into several layers. Each of them
is identified by a unique name and color.  SMD circuits are also supported.
.IP
* @MAX_LAYER@ layers are supported in addition to a silkscreen layer.
Visibility of layers, pins and SMD pads and vias is controllable.
.IP
* All files are 7 bit ASCII and can be preprocessed with any UNIX command
that writes it's results to \fIstdout\fP (\fIGNU m4\fP is required).
.IP
* The layout grid is anywhere in the range from 1/1000 inch up to 250/1000
inch. The maximum is defined at compilation time.
.IP
* Zooming is supported.
.IP
* A copy of the current data is saved temporarily in /tmp to
ensure that nothing is lost during critical sections of the program.
.IP
* An unlimited (depending on memory) undo operations
is supported. Also redo is available in case you change your mind.

.P
Pcb is intended to be a flexible tool that can be used many ways.It
now has an autorouter. Most of the settings can be specified by resources, passed
in the command-line or changed at runtime. Layout related settings are saved
together with the data.

.SH OPTIONS

.P
Beside the toolkit options, Pcb recognizes some command-line options
with following syntax:
\-option switches it on, +option switches it off

.TP
.BI \-alldirections,+alldirections
Enables or disables lines in any direction. Overrides the resource
\fIallDirectionLines\fP.
.TP
.BI \-backup " <value>"
Time in seconds between two backups. Overrides the resource
\fIbackupInterval\fP.
.TP
.BI \-c " <value>"
Number of characters per output-line. Overrides the resource
\fIcharactersPerLine\fP.
.TP
.BI \-fontfile " <filename>"
The default font is read from this file. The file is, together with a path,
passed to an external program. The path is defined by the resource
\fIfontPath\fP wheras the command uses \fIfontCommand\fP.
Overwrittes the resource \fIfontFile\fP.
.TP
.BI \-lelement " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
Sets the command to be executed when an element is loaded.
The command may contain %f which is replaced by the filename and %p
which is replaced by the element search-path. The command must write it's
results to \fIstdout\fP. The resource \fIelementCommand\fP is overwritten.
.TP
.BI \-lfile " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
Sets the command to be executed when an layout file is loaded.
The command may contain %f which is replaced by the filename and %p which is
replaced by the search-path. The command must write it's results to
\fIstdout\fP. The resource \fIfileCommand\fP is overwritten.
.TP
.BI \-lfont " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
Sets the command to be executed when an fontfile is loaded.
The command may contain %f which is replaced by the filename and %p which
is replaced by the font search-path. The command must write it's results to
\fIstdout\fP. The resource \fIfontCommand\fP is overwritten.
.TP
.BI \-lg " <layergroups>"
This option overwrites the resource \fIlayerGroups\fP. See its description
for more information.
.TP
.BI \-libname " <filename>"
The default filename for the library. Overwrites the resource
\fIlibraryFilename\fP.
.TP
.BI \-libtree " <filename>"
The default directory for the element-file libraries. Overwrides the resource
\fIlibraryTree\fP.
.TP
.BI \-libpath " <path>"
The default search path for the the library. Overwrites the resource
\fIlibraryPath\fP.
.TP
.BI \-llib " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
Sets the command to be executed when an element is loaded from the library.
The command may contain %f and %p to pass the requested filename
and the searchpath to the command. %a is replaces by the three arguments
\fItemplate\fP, \fIvalue\fP and \fIpackage\fP. The command must write
the data to its standard output. The related resource is \fIlibraryCommand\fP.
.TP
.BI \-llibcont " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
The command lists the contents of the library.
The command may contain %f and %p to pass the library filename
and the searchpath to the command.
The related resource is \fIlibraryContentsCommand\fP.
.TP
.BI \-loggeometry " <geometry>"
Determines the geometry of the logging window.
.TP
.BI \-pnl " <positiv integer value>"
Defines the maximum length of a pin name to be displayed in a pinout
window. Overwrittes the resource \fPpinoutNameLength\fI.
.TP
.BI \-pz " <positiv integer value>"
Sets the zoom factor for pinout window according to the
formula: scale = 1:(2^value). The resource \fPpinoutZoom\fI is
overwritten.
.TP
.BI \-reset/+reset
If enabled, all found connections are reset after an element has been scanned.
This setting is only used while scanning connections to all elements.
Overrides the resource \fIresetAfterElement\fP.
.TP
.BI \-ring/+ring
Overrides the resource \fIringBellWhenFinished\fP. If enabled, the bell
on the keyboard is rang when connection searching has finished.
.TP
.BI \-s/+s
Enables/Disables the saving of the previous commandline. Overrides the
\fIsaveLastCommand\fP resource.
.TP
.BI \-save/+save
Overrides the resource \fIsaveInTMP\fP. If enabled all data is saved
in a temporary file in the directory \fI/tmp\fP instead of being lost.
.TP
.BI \-sfile " <\fIUNIX\fP command>"
Sets the command to be executed when an layout file is saved.
The command may contain %f which is replaced by the filename. The command
must read it's data from \fIstdin\fP. The resource \fIsaveCommand\fP is
overwritten.
.TP
.BI \-size " <width>x<height>"
Overrides the resource \fIsize\fP which determines the maximum size
of a layout.
.TP .BI \-v " <\-100..100>"
Sets the volume of the X-speaker. Overrides the resource \fIvolume\fP.


.P
In addition to these 'normal-work-options' you will find additional
special options, \fI\-copyright\fP, \fI-help\fP and \fI\-version\fP,
which print out the GNU COPYLEFT notice, a usage message and the current
version.


.SH X11 Interface
