# ---- Sample pcbrc file
#
# A pcbrc file provides various configuration options for customizing
# a pcb library environment beyond the installed defaults.  These pcbrc
# files are loaded in this order if they exist:
#
# /etc/pcbrc
# /usr/local/etc/pcbrc
# ${prefix}/share/pcb/pcbrc
# ~/.pcb/pcbrc
# ./pcbrc
#
# Which allows for system wide, pcb install specific, user specific, and
# project specific customization.  All of these options may also be
# specified on the command line which will override any pcbrc settings
# unless it is an append or prepend option.
# If an append or prepend path is given on the command line, there must
# be no spaces after the += or =+.  Eg:  pcb --element-path +=path
# Final library paths and commands can be seen when running pcb in
# verbose mode:  pcb -v

# Uncomment and edit any desired customization options below.  For the
# defaults given, a ${prefix} is the install prefix.  It defaults to
# /usr/local and is set to other values via the --prefix configure arg.



# Execute an initial action at startup.  This has no default.
#
#action-string	some actions

# Execute the actions in a script file at startup.  This has no default.
#
#action-script  script-filename


# ------------ library options -----------------
# Set the directory to search for the library command and library contents
# command.  This defaults to:  ${prefix}/share/pcb/
#
# lib-command-dir  directory

# Set the library command for copying elements from the library.
# This defaults to:  QueryLibrary.sh '%p' '%f' %a
#
#lib-command command

# Set the library contents command for listing the library contents.
# This defaults to:  ListLibraryContents.sh '%p' '%f'
#
#lib-contents-command command

# Set or add to the library search path.  One of the three forms below
# may used to respectively set, append to or prepend to the search path.
# This defaults to:  ${prefix}/share/pcb
#
#lib-path  path
#lib-path += path
#lib-path =+ path

# Set or add to the newlib library path.  The set, append to or prepend to
# forms may be used here as well.  Components to this path are also
# per user configurable via the gui Preferences->Library and paths entered
# there are prepended to the final path after all rc files have been
# processed.  This defaults to:  ${prefix}/share/pcb/newlib
#
#lib-newlib path
#lib-newlib += path
#lib-newlib =+ path


# ------------- layout font -----------------
# Set the font command for processing the layout font file.
# This defaults to:  M4PATH='%p';export M4PATH;echo 'include(%f)' | m4
# where 'm4' may be the GNU 'gm4' as detected when configure was run.
#
#font-command  command

# Set the font path to search for the layout font file.
# This defaults to:  .:${prefix}/share/pcb
#
#font-path path
#font-path += path
#font-path =+ path

# Set the layout font file name, defaults to:  default_font
#
#font-file  filename


# --------------- elements -------------------
# Set the command to load element files.
# This defaults to:  M4PATH='%p';export M4PATH;echo 'include(%f)' | m4
# where, again, m4 may be gm4
#
#element-command  command

# Set the element paths to search for elements.
# This defaults to:  ${prefix}/share/pcb
#
#element-path  path
#element-path += path
#element-path =+ path


# ---------------- misc ------------------
# Set the defualt file name sequence to be used for printouts.
#
#print-file  %f.output

# These options are shown with their default value and are
# unlikely to need customization.
#
#file-command  cat '%f
#save-command  cat - > '%f'

# These options will set values used as the default for new layouts
# and they are also user settable via the Preferences gui.  If these
# options are given in a pcbrc file, they *will* override the users
# Preference settings.
#
#groups layer-group-string
#routes route-styles-string
#board-size <width>x<height>
