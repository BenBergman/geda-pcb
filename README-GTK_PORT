This PCB Gtk port is a work in progress.  It can be compiled and
used, but one should be on the lookout for bugs.  pcb-gtk is
a description and should not be considered a naming of the port.

After untarring,
	cd pcb-<version>
	./configure
	make

or, if you want an install somewhere other than /usr/local,
make the configure step, for example:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

to test run it:
    cd src
    ./pcbtest.sh

You can then do:
    make install

This will install the gtk pcb as "pcb" just as the Xt pcb install
would.  If you have an existing Xt install and don't want to lose
it, then don't don a "make install" here, but instead you can
copy the src/pcb-bin binary to some bin directory as pcb-test or
gpcb (as I will now call it), or whatever.  This should work provided
the "prefix" the configure step uses is the same as was used for your
existing Xt install.  The gpcb binary will run regardless, it just
needs the right prefix to find the installed libraries.

When gpcb runs, it uses a ~/.pcb directory for saving the preferences
file and color schemes.
