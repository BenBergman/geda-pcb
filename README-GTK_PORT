This source tree is the PCB Gtk port and cannot be compiled to
use the Xaw/Xt interface as used by the original PCB.

Note: Users of Fedora Core 2 and below may experience GLib/GObject
runtime warnings when reading layout files or starting a new layout.
These warnings are not fatal, and are due to a bug in Gtk-2.4.0 and
below.  Upgrade to the latest Gtk version to eliminate the warnings.


After untarring,
	cd pcb-<version>
	./configure
	make

or, if you want an install somewhere other than /usr/local,
make the configure step, for example:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

to test run it:
    cd src
    ./pcbtest.sh

You can then do (back in the pcb-<version> directory):
    make install

This will install the gtk pcb as "pcb" just as the Xaw pcb install
would.  If you have an existing Xaw install and don't want to lose
it, then don't do a "make install" here, but instead you can
copy the src/pcb-bin binary to some bin directory as pcb-test or
gpcb (as I will now call it), or whatever.  This should work provided
the "prefix" the configure step uses is the same as was used for your
existing Xt install.  The gpcb binary will run regardless, it just
needs the right prefix to find the installed libraries.

When gpcb (pcb if you installed) runs, it uses a ~/.pcb directory for
saving the preferences file and color schemes.
